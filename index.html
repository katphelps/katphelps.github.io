                    I'm Kat, a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University studying Information Systems with a focus in Quantiative Anslysis.
                    On campus I'm involved in Greek Sing, CMU's MakerSpace, and the Statistics Department.
                    <br></br>
                    This summer I'll be working at Google as a Technical Program Manager in New York. I'll be working on a corporate
                    engineering team that uses data science to inform leadership on their decisions.
                    <br></br>
                    I'm interested in Quantitative, Data Science, and PM positions for Summer 2021 Internships.

                        for the following year under Professor Weinberg. Both semesters I was the recitation leader and taught my
                        students on ISLE, the intergrated software learning environment, that the class uses to uniquely teach
                        students statistical tools online. Using the software I taught skills such as EDA, probability, hypothesis
                        tests, and research methods. Besides leading my weekly recitation I graded projects, papers, tests, and
                        proctored exams.

                        regression to analyze which predictors most accurately predicted the temperature. The project then moved
                        into a group stage where we consolidated our findings and created an academic poster to present at

                        were hand developed in order to fufill the goals of the web app. The views were creating using materialize
                        and followed standard design concepts and theories. Concerns such as secruity, database
                        integrity, sustainability, and technical debt were taken into consideration and dealt with appropriately.
